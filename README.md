layer7-psdash
=============

This module deploys PSDash (https://github.com/Jahaja/psdash). I am in no way affiliated with Jahaja and his project. 

Puppet Module that deploys PSDash onto your machine. PSDash allows for quick and easy System Monitoring

This module is in it's early development stages and has been known to (softly?) break Puppet runs.

Use at your own discretion. I advise a virtual environment.
